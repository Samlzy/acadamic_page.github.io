title: About Me (关于我)
---

I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in the Dept. of Automation, Tsinghua University. My research interests include *Online Active Learning*, *Online Semi-supervised Learning*, *eXplainable Artificial Intelligence* (XAI), *Decision-making*, *Information Fusion*, and their applications in *Real-time Fault Diagnosis* and *Real-time Safety Assessment* of dynamic systems. Currently, I focus on applying *stream learning* techniques under constrained annotations to the complex dynamic systems in industrial processes.

我目前是一名博士生，就读于清华大学自动化系。我的研究兴趣主要包括在线主动学习、在线半监督学习、可解释人工智能（XAI）、智能决策、信息融合以及它们在实时故障诊断和动态系统的实时安全评估中的应用。当前，我的研究重点是将受约束注释下的“流学习”技术应用于工业过程中的复杂动态系统。

I studied in the School of Computer and Information Science at Southwest University for the B.E. degree. My major was Computer Science and Technology. During my undergraduate studies, I served as a research assistant in the research groups of Prof. [Y. Deng](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Zuhod6sAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao) and Prof. [F. Xiao](http://www.cse.cqu.edu.cn/info/2095/5902.htm), respectively, and carried out research work related to intelligent decision science. After receiving my B.E. degree, I was recommended to study directly for a Ph.D. degree in the Department of Automation at Tsinghua University, majoring in Control Science and Control Engineering. I am currently advised by Prof. [X. He](https://www.au.tsinghua.edu.cn/info/1092/1527.htm) and Prof. [D.-H. Zhou](https://www.au.tsinghua.edu.cn/info/1077/1623.htm) from [Dept. of Automation](https://www.au.tsinghua.edu.cn/index.htm), Tsinghua University.

我在西南大学计算机与信息科学学院获得了工学学士学位，主修计算机科学与技术。在本科期间，我曾在邓勇教授和肖富元教授的指导下从事智能决策科学相关的研究工作。在取得学士学位后，我被保送至清华大学自动化系直接攻读博士学位。当前，我正在何潇教授和周东华教授课题组开展研究工作。
