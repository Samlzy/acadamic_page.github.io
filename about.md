title: About Me
---

I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in the Dept. of Automation, Tsinghua University. My research interests include *Online Active Learning*, *Online Semi-supervised Learning*, *eXplainable Artificial Intelligence* (XAI), *Decision-making*, *Information Fusion*, and their applications in *Real-time Fault Diagnosis* and *Real-time Safety Assessment* of dynamic systems. Currently, I focus on applying *stream learning* techniques under constrained annotations to the complex dynamic systems in industrial processes.

I studied in the School of Computer and Information Science at Southwest University for the B.E. degree. My major was Computer Science and Technology. During my undergraduate studies, I served as a research assistant in the research groups of Prof. [Y. Deng](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Zuhod6sAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao) and Prof. [F. Xiao](http://www.cse.cqu.edu.cn/info/2095/5902.htm), respectively, and carried out research work related to intelligent decision science. After receiving my B.E. degree, I was recommended to study directly for a Ph.D. degree in the Department of Automation at Tsinghua University, majoring in Control Science and Control Engineering. I am currently advised by Prof. [X. He](https://www.au.tsinghua.edu.cn/info/1092/1527.htm) and Prof. [D.-H. Zhou](https://www.au.tsinghua.edu.cn/info/1077/1623.htm) from [Dept. of Automation](https://www.au.tsinghua.edu.cn/index.htm), Tsinghua University.
