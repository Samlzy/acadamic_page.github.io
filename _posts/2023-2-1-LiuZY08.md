## Description

**Title**: Dynamic model interpretation-guided online active learning scheme for real-time safety assessmen

**Journal**: *IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics*

**Abstract**: Chunk-based real-time safety assessment of dynamic systems is of great significance for the timely discovery of industrial risks and reduction of losses. However, existing methods have certain limitations in dealing with such issues, especially in non-stationary environments. Generally, potential concept drift needs to be detected interpretively, which is inevitable in many cases. The incremental learning scheme should also be well considered. In this paper, the dynamic model interpretation-guided online active learning scheme, termed DMI-LS, is proposed. Specifically, the model update strategy with chunk data is designed based on the implementation of the broad learning system. A novel query strategy is then investigated to consider the ranking preference difference, which relies on the interpretation generated by the explainable artificial intelligence method. Several experiments based on the JiaoLong deep-sea manned submersible data are conducted to verify the effects of the proposed DMI-LS. The results show that it outperforms the other advanced existing approaches with different settings in most scenarios.
