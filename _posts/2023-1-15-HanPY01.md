## Description

**Title**: A minority pseudo-label prioritized online semi-supervised random vector functional link network approach for industrial real-time fault diagnosis

**Abstract**: Industrial real-time fault diagnosis is vital to ensure efficient and safe production. In the literature, existing methods usually do not systematically consider some realistic constraints in dealing with the above problem, such as real-time model update, sample imbalance, and high cost of labeling. In this paper, a minority pseudo-label prioritized online semi-supervised random vector functional link network approach, termed MPPOS-RVFL, is proposed to cope with the above issue. Specifically, the pseudo-labeling technique is introduced to reduce the negative impact of the imbalanced data stream. In this context, the minority pseudo-label prioritized approach is designed to enhance the model’s ability to identify unlabeled minority samples. Several experiments with the Tennessee Eastman process are conducted to verify the practicality of MPPOS-RVFL. The results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the existing advanced approaches in accuracy and time consumption.
