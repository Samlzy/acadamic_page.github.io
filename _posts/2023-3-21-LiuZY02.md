## Description

**Title**: Contrastive preference-guided active learning approach based on ranking correlation for chunk-level real-time safety assessment

**Journal**: *IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering*

**Abstract**: Chunk-level real-time safety assessment is a critical process for identifying and analyzing potential safety hazards in industrial applications. Active learning has been widely rec- ognized as an effective technique for addressing such issues by utilizing small labeled samples to achieve high evaluation performance. However, in real-world scenarios, the performance of query strategies can be significantly impacted by the data environment. Therefore, it is crucial to co-design strategy using different criteria to ensure reliable and stable safety assess- ment results for system operation. In this paper, we propose a contrastive preference-guided active learning approach to tackle chunk-level real-time safety assessment tasks in non- stationary environments. Firstly, we construct negative ranking lists and random lists. Then, we introduce Jeffrey divergence to measure pairwise ranking correlation. By leveraging contrastive preference relationships, we can effectively obtain the value of samples in data chunks with preference aggregation procedures. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, we conduct numerous experiments using realistic data from the JiaoLong deep-sea manned submersible. The results demonstrate that our approach outperforms most existing advanced methods in terms of performance stability and accuracy.
