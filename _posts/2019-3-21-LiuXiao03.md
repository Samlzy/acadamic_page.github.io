## Description

**Title**: An interval-valued exceedance method in MCDM with uncertain satisfactions

**Journal**: *International Journal of Intelligent Systems*

**Abstract**: Multicriteria decision‐making problems have been applied to many applications for its practicality. Nevertheless, when the evaluated satisfactions are more complex, such as interval‐valued distributions, how to reasonably obtain the aggregation results of alternatives is still an open issue. In this paper, an interval‐valued exceedance method is proposed to solve such a question based on the Golden Rule representative value and probabilistic exceedance method. Due to good performance of expressing uncertain information, the Golden Rule representative value method is used to order interval‐valued satisfactions after an effective normalization process. In addition, a quantifier‐based ordered weighted averaging operator is also introduced to consider the preferences of decision makers. A realistic application of supplier selection is shown to illustrate the practicality of the proposed method.
