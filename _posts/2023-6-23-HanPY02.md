*Online Minority-cluster Informed Semi-supervised Random Vector Functional Link Network Approach for Multi-mode Fault Diagnosis*

## Description

**Title**: Online minority-cluster informed semi-supervised random vector functional link network approach for multi-mode fault diagnosis

**Abstract**: Industrial real-time fault diagnosis is vital to ensure efficient and safe production. In the literature, existing methods usually do not systematically consider some realistic constraints under multi-mode scenarios, such as high labeling costs and sample imbalance. In this paper, an online minority-cluster informed semi-supervised random vector functional link network approach, termed OMIS-RVFL, is proposed to cope with the above issue. Specifically, the pseudo-labeling technique is introduced to mitigate the negative impact of the imbalanced data stream. On this basis, the minority-cluster informed approach is designed to increase the linear separability of transition samples and achieve better identification of minority samples by performing dimensionality reduction and minority prioritization. Several experiments with the Tennessee Eastman process are conducted to verify the practicality of OMIS-RVFL. The results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the existing state-of-the-art approaches regarding multi-mode fault diagnosis performance.
