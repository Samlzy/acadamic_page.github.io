## Description

**Title**: An online active broad learning approach for real-time safety assessment of dynamic systems in nonstationary environments

**Journal**: *IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems*

**Abstract**: Real-time safety assessment of the complex dynamic systems in nonstationary environments is of great significance for avoiding the potential hazards. In this case, the update procedure with high assessment accuracy and training speed is crucial and meaningful in the dynamic streaming setting. Generally, the performance of most online learning approaches will be negatively affected by limited annotated samples in such a setting. Moreover, the time cost of advanced conventional methods with retaining procedures is relatively high, constraining their practicality. In this article, a novel online active broad learning approach, termed OABL, is proposed. In detail, the effectiveness of the broad learning system in the framework of online active learning is first revealed and verified. A reasonable dynamic asymmetric query strategy is then designed with a limited annotation budget to actively annotate the relatively valuable samples, which is beneficial to mitigating the negative effects of class imbalance. In this context, the advantage of the human-in-the-loop characteristic is also effectively used to control the evolution direction of the learner during the incremental update, which makes it better able to adapt to complex and nonstationary environments. Several related experiments are conducted with the realistic data of JiaoLong deep-sea manned submersible. Results show the effectiveness and practicality of the proposal compared with the existing advanced approaches.
