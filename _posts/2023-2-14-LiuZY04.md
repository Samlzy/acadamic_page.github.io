## Description

**Title**: Fault diagnosis of rotating machinery with limited expert interaction: a multi-criteria active learning approach based on broad learning system

**Journal**: *IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology*

**Abstract**: Recently, research on the fault diagnosis of rotating machinery, especially for the compound or unknown cases, has drawn increasing attention. Some advanced learning-based approaches have achieved good fault diagnosis performance to some degree. However, in practical applications, how to utilize prior knowledge as fully as possible for fault diagnosis with constraints of limited expert interaction remains an open issue. In this brief, a fault diagnosis methodology of rotating machinery with limited expert interaction is proposed. With related feature extraction techniques, a novel multicriteria active learning (MCAL) query strategy is designed to select the relatively valuable samples for annotation. In addition, the broad learning system (BLS) is exploited to achieve fast incrementally updating or retrain procedures with high diagnostic accuracy in different diagnosis scenarios. Several experiments are conducted on a real-world rotating machinery fault diagnosis (RMFD) experimental platform. Compared with other existing advanced approaches, the diagnosis performance of the proposal shows high stability and flexibility. The annotation cost of experts is also significantly reduced, which makes the proposal more suitable for dealing with practical problems.
