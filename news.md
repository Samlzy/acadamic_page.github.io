- 2023.7.3: A paper entitled "Dynamic submodular-based learning strategy in imbalanced drifting streams for real-time safety assessment in nonstationary environments" was accepted by the international journal of *IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems*.


- 2023.6.26: A paper entitled "Real-time safety assessment of dynamic systems in non-stationary environments: A review of methods and techniques" was accepted at the *CAA Symposium on Fault Detection, Supervision, and Safety for Technical Processes* (SAFEPROCESS) conference.


- 2023.5.15: Recently, an important academic paper has been anounced published in the journal *Reviews of Environmental Contamination and Toxicology*, titled "*Analytical Methods, Occurrence, Fate, and Toxicity of Ethylmercury in the Environment: Review and Outlook*". Analytical methods, occurrences, fate, and toxicity of ethylmercury in the environment are discussed in depth and an outlook is provided. 
This is a very important piece of research with great implications for protecting our environment and our health. I am so proud and excited for my girlfriend to be recognized and appreciated for her efforts and talents. I believe her research will make more contributions to the field of environmental science. Let's congratulate her and look forward to more of her future achievements!
